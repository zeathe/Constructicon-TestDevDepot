# Don't Pay Attention to This Project #########################################

This project is actually a copy of
[Constructicon-Example](https://github.com/zeathe/Constructicon-Examples)
 that has been hacked and slashed during the development of Constructicon.

This shouldn't be really useful at all for anyone other than developers of
constructicon itself.
